Welcome to Colloquium!

It looks like this is the first time you've used Colloquium.  Keep reading to understand a little bit about how Colloquium works and how to use it.


Philosophy
----------

If you're reading this, you've probably had to sit through too many low-quality talks, lectures or presentations.

There are, of course, many reasons why a given talk might be bad, but very often it's because they lack a coherent, organised narrative or story.

Traditional presentation software, or *slideware*, helps you to design visual aids (slides).  The results might be visually stunning, but there's so much more to giving a good talk.

Traditional slideware encourages you to use your slides as the framework of your talk.  Often this results in lists of bullet points (see below), which the presenter reads out.

Better speakers will use the hidden "presenter notes" feature to prompt themselves, but the slides still form the basic structure of the talk.

Colloquium works differently to other presentation programs by making *narrative*, not *slides*, the centre of attention.  Your slides, or other visual aids, are embedded into the narrative text, like this:

Colloquium encourages you to focus on the narrative of your talk, to figure out what you're trying to say, and to use visual aids at appropriate moments to enhance the message.


Writing a presentation
----------------------

Simply type into this window as you would into a text editor or word processor.

To add a new slide or other kind of visual aid, just drag and drop the image files into this window, use the "Add" button in the toolbar, or Insert→Slide in the menu bar.  Supported formats include PNG, SVG and PDF.

Double-click an image to get a closer look at it.  This will open a new slide view window, which will become important when giving the presentation (see later).

Note that the graphics can have different slides and aspect ratios.  Colloquium will take care of displaying them at an appropriate size.

Colloquium shows an estimated running time for your presentation at the bottom of this window.  This estimate depends on how fast you speak, but also on how detailed your narrative is — perhaps you choose to script everything word-for-word, or perhaps you make short notes.  You can change the "calibration" for this in the preferences window (tab "Presentation") in the Edit menu.


Giving the presentation
-----------------------

First, open as many slide views as you need.  You might only need one, usually full-screen on a projector, but it's often useful to have a second window on your personal screen.  Double-click any image or slide to open a window, or use "Tools→Open new slide window" in the menu bar.  Double-click a slide window to make it full-screen.

You can directly open a full-screen slide view by using "Tools→Open new full-screen slide window on display" and selecting the correct video output.

There is no "presenter view" mode to take over your screen.  You can lay out Colloquium's windows, and any others you might need, on your private display to match your own requirements.

Now, select "Tools->Start presenting from here" in the menu bar.  This will switch Colloquium into *presentation mode*, where your position in the narrative controls which slide is displayed by the slide view windows.

Press page up\/page down to move through the text as you speak it out.  The current paragraph will be highlighted.  When you advance past a slide's thumbnail, that slide will be displayed in _all_ slide view windows.  To jump to a slide, double-click on its thumbnail in this window.

To leave presentation mode, click the button in the toolbar.  To restore a full-screen window to normal, press Escape with the window focused.


Tips for using Colloquium effectively
-------------------------------------

Use the Presentation Clock (find it in the Tools menu) to keep on track.  It estimates how far through the narrative you should be, based on the amount of elapsed time.

The presentation clock makes much more sense in real life than in a still image, so why not give it a try now, using this file?

Use the test card (also in the Tools menu) for a quick check of the video equipment.  Use it to spot clipped screen edges and colour problems.  When the menu item is chosen, the test card will appear on all open slide view windows and stay there until another slide is triggered as described above.

Even if you script your talks word-for-word, it's important to avoid *looking like* you're reading text from a page.  There is a certain skill to this, but it's quite easy to learn.  The confidence you will gain from a firm narrative will be visible.  However, even if you haven't quite mastered it, the results will still be better than to confuse your audience by losing your thread of argument in pursuit of an appearance of spontaneity.

We hope you enjoy using Colloquium, and that it helps you to give good presentations!
