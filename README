Summary
-------

Colloquium is a presentation program that is more than just "slideware".
Instead of concentrating on slides, Colloquium makes the "narrative" of your
presentation the most important thing.  Slides are embedded in your narrative,
forming part of the flow of your talk.


Installation instructions
-------------------------

Colloquium uses the Meson build system (http://mesonbuild.com).  You will need
to install Meson, which is probably in your distribution package manager.
For example:
$ sudo dnf install meson
or
$ sudo apt install meson

You will also need the GTK 3 development files, which are also probably in your
distribution if they are not already installed:
$ sudo dnf install  gtk3-devel
or
$ sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev

If you're running OS X, please install Homebrew (https://brew.sh), and the all dependencies:
$ brew install gettext meson ninja gtk+3

Then set up the build directory using Meson:
$ meson builddir   # where "builddir" is your name for the build directory

Meson will (by default) create Ninja files which behave like makefiles.
Compile Colloquium using Ninja:
$ ninja -C builddir  # where "builddir" matches the previous step

To install:
$ sudo ninja -C builddir install

You can have multiple build directories, perhaps with different configurations.


Running the program
-------------------

Colloquium should appear in your desktop environment's menus.  Alternatively,
it can be started from the command line:
$ colloquium

The first time Colloquium runs, it will show an introduction document.
