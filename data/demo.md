Welcome to Colloquium!
======================

It looks like this is the first time you've used Colloquium.  Keep reading to understand a little bit about how Colloquium works and how to use it.

Colloquium works differently to other presentation programs by making *narrative*, not *slides*, the centre of attention.

Slides come when you need to illustrate something.  This window is called the _narrative editor_.  Your slides are embedded into the narrative text, like this:

You can add a new slide from the "Insert" menu or using the toolbar at the top of the narrative window.  Try it now: click to place the cursor at the end of this paragraph, then add a new slide.

➡️ Use it just to help plan a smooth flow for your talk, reading it through to spot awkward transitions.

➡️ Write your talk word for word.  Deliver your talk precisely as you planned it, no matter how nervous you get.

➡️ Write bullet-pointed notes to structure your talk.

➡️ Create a written version of your talk to print out and give to your audience as a handout.

➡️ Use it as a journal, adding slides whenever you have an illustration.  You'll have a ready-made presentation on your activity, with no extra effort!


The test card
-------------

Use the test card to make sure your computer is talking to the projector correctly.  It shows you the resolution of the screen, where it thinks the edges are, and some colours.  This helps you spot and fix all-too-common display problems early.
